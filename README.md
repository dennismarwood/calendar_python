Automating some calendar entry. Took this chance to learn about threading and mocking. Also gave an opporturnity to work with google api.
This program will listen for entries that you want to be loaded into google calendar, parse them, and then interact with google api to add them.
I also have a rust program that feeds this program the calendar entries.
